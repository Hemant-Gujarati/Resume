# my-portfolio-
This repository contains my evolving portfolio, designed to present who I am and what I create. It features academic achievements, Python programming projects, and engineering concepts, alongside a growing collection of hands-on tech experiments. The portfolio is still in progress and will be updated regularly with new projects and improvements.
